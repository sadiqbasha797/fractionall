# Frontend-User Blocked Dates Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds blocked dates functionality to the frontend-user application, preventing users from booking blocked dates and displaying them visually on the calendar.

## Implementation Details

### 1. New Service: BlockedDateService
**File:** `frontend-user/src/app/services/blocked-date.service.ts`

The service provides methods for:
- Getting blocked dates for specific cars (Public API)
- Checking date availability
- Helper methods for date validation and formatting
- Blocked date range checking

### 2. Updated Bookings Component
**Files:** 
- `frontend-user/src/app/bookings/bookings.ts`
- `frontend-user/src/app/bookings/bookings.html`

#### Key Features Added:

##### Calendar Integration:
- **Visual Indicators**: Blocked dates are shown in orange color on the calendar
- **Tooltips**: Hover over blocked dates to see the reason (e.g., "Blocked: Maintenance")
- **Legend**: Added calendar legend explaining all color codes
- **Availability Logic**: Blocked dates are marked as unavailable for booking

##### Booking Validation:
- **Pre-submission Check**: Validates selected date range against blocked dates
- **User-friendly Messages**: Clear error messages explaining why dates are blocked
- **Real-time Feedback**: Immediate feedback when users try to select blocked dates

##### Data Loading:
- **Automatic Loading**: Blocked dates are loaded for all user's cars on component initialization
- **Reactive Updates**: Calendar updates automatically when blocked dates are loaded
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of API errors

### 3. User Experience Enhancements

#### Calendar Visual Design:
- **Available Dates**: Sky blue - clickable for booking
- **Your Bookings**: Green - shows your existing bookings
- **Others' Bookings**: Red - shows dates booked by other users
- **Blocked Dates**: Orange - shows maintenance/blocked periods
- **Past Dates**: Gray - not available for booking

#### Interactive Features:
- **Click Prevention**: Users cannot click on blocked dates
- **Hover Information**: Tooltips show blocking reason
- **Form Validation**: Booking form prevents submission of blocked date ranges
- **Clear Messaging**: Specific error messages for different blocking scenarios

## Technical Implementation

### Calendar Day Interface Update:
```typescript
interface CalendarDay {
  number: number;
  isEmpty: boolean;
  isAvailable: boolean;
  isBooked: boolean;
  isFirstOrLast: boolean;
  isBookedByUser: boolean;
  isBookedByOthers: boolean;
  isBlocked: boolean;           // NEW
  blockedReason?: string;        // NEW
  date?: Date;
}
```

### Blocked Date Loading:
```typescript
private loadBlockedDates(): void {
  // Loads blocked dates for all user's cars
  // Updates calendar with blocked date information
  // Handles errors gracefully
}
```

### Booking Validation:
```typescript
// Check for blocked dates before booking submission
const blockedDatesInRange = this.blockedDateService.hasBlockedDatesInRange(
  this.blockedDates(), 
  fromDate, 
  toDate
);

if (blockedDatesInRange.length > 0) {
  const reason = blockedDatesInRange[0].reason || 'Maintenance';
  alert(`Selected dates are blocked due to ${reason.toLowerCase()}. Please choose different dates.`);
  return;
}
```

### Calendar Rendering:
```typescript
// Calendar day generation includes blocked date checking
const blockedDateInfo = this.blockedDateService.getBlockedDateInfo(this.blockedDates(), currentDate);
const isBlocked = !!blockedDateInfo;

this.calendarDays.push({
  // ... other properties
  isAvailable: !isBooked && !isPastDate && !isBlocked,
  isBlocked: isBlocked,
  blockedReason: blockedDateInfo?.reason,
});
```

## User Workflow

### 1. Calendar View:
- Users see blocked dates in orange color
- Hover over blocked dates to see the reason
- Blocked dates are not clickable
- Legend explains all calendar colors

### 2. Booking Process:
- Users select available dates (sky blue)
- If they try to select blocked dates, they get an immediate error message
- When submitting booking form, system validates against blocked dates
- Clear error messages explain why certain dates cannot be booked

### 3. Error Messages:
- **Calendar Click**: "This date is blocked due to maintenance. Please select a different date."
- **Form Submission**: "Selected dates are blocked due to maintenance. Please choose different dates."

## API Integration

### Endpoints Used:
- `GET /api/blocked-dates/car/:carId` - Get blocked dates for specific car
- `POST /api/blocked-dates/check-availability` - Check date availability

### Data Flow:
1. Component loads user's cars from tickets
2. For each car, loads blocked dates from API
3. Combines all blocked dates into single array
4. Updates calendar with blocked date information
5. Validates user selections against blocked dates

## Error Handling

### API Errors:
- Graceful handling of network failures
- Silent error handling for blocked dates loading
- User-friendly error messages for booking validation

### User Input Validation:
- Prevents selection of blocked dates
- Validates date ranges against blocked periods
- Provides specific error messages for different scenarios

## Performance Considerations

### Efficient Loading:
- Loads blocked dates for all user cars in parallel
- Uses signals for reactive updates
- Minimal API calls by batching requests

### Calendar Performance:
- Efficient date comparison algorithms
- Minimal DOM updates using Angular signals
- Optimized calendar rendering

## Security

### Data Access:
- Only loads blocked dates for user's accessible cars
- Uses public API endpoints (no authentication required for blocked dates)
- Validates all user inputs on both client and server side

### User Experience:
- Clear visual indicators prevent confusion
- Informative error messages help users understand restrictions
- Consistent behavior across all booking interfaces

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements could include:
- **Recurring Blocked Dates**: Support for weekly/monthly maintenance schedules
- **Advanced Notifications**: Email alerts when blocked dates are added
- **Mobile Optimization**: Enhanced mobile calendar experience
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader support for calendar legend
- **Analytics**: Track blocked date impact on booking patterns

## Testing

The implementation includes:
- **Unit Tests**: Service methods and helper functions
- **Integration Tests**: API communication and data flow
- **User Experience Tests**: Calendar interaction and validation
- **Error Handling Tests**: Network failures and edge cases

## Conclusion

The blocked dates implementation provides a comprehensive solution for preventing users from booking during maintenance periods while maintaining an excellent user experience. The visual calendar integration, clear error messaging, and robust validation ensure users understand and respect blocked date restrictions.
